## V. Conclusion
* Traffic Trends: Website traffic remained stable from January to March 2017, with March recording the highest number of visits (69,931), indicating consistent user interest over the quarter.
* Revenue by Source: In June 2017, direct traffic was the leading revenue driver, followed by Google and Mail, highlighting the strong performance of these acquisition channels.
* Bounce Rate Insights: Sources such as phandroid.com had a high bounce rate (77.78%), suggesting poor landing page engagement and the need for content or UX improvements.
* Purchaser Behavior: Customers who purchased the YouTube Men‚Äôs Vintage Henley often showed interest in similar items like the Google Men‚Äôs Vintage Badge Tee Black, signaling strong cross-selling potential.
* This project leveraged SQL and Google BigQuery to analyze a large eCommerce dataset derived from Google Analytics.
* Key performance metrics such as visits, pageviews, transactions, bounce rates, and revenue by source were explored to surface actionable insights.
* These findings can support informed decision-making for marketing optimization, product bundling, and UX enhancements.
* As a next step, visualizing these insights using Power BI or Tableau would further enhance stakeholder understanding and strategic planning.
